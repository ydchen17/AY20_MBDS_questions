# AY20_MBDS_questions

Here are the answers to interview questions for the MSc Biomedical Data Science Programme at NTU singapore. Overall, this is a bit less biology-related than I expected. I have tried all questions. Most of the code is written in Python within Jupyter Notebook, although some R is used. Therefore, there might be some problem if you are to run all code without [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel), which allows me to run R in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook allows some explanations added to the code while I was writing the code and any further discussion will be helpful and welcomed.
