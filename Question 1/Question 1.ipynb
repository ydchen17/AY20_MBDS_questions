    "As illustrated, there must be only $(m-1)$ downward steps and $(n-1)$ rightward steps to be taken, which can be all projected to the long and short sides of the matrix. Since the turning point isthe steps end up in the same destination, where further steps are not needed, the final step number is $(m+n-2)$. Therefore, it is just like that there are $(m+n-2)$ slots, halves to be filled with letters \"R\" and \"D\", respectively. More precisely, it is just like an abacus. \"R\" is like a small counting rods which represents a smaller value, while \"D\" is like a large counting rod which represent a larger value for the small counting rods after it. Then how we should calculate the sum value for these rods? \n",

    "When we add small rods, i.e. \"R\", to the right of the first large rods, i.e. \"D\", the value gradually increase. Therefore, the more small rods on the far right part of the path, the larger the total sum is. For example, for a $5\\times5$ matrix, there are 4 small and large rods respectively. The path with largest sum should be like \"DDDDRRRR\", while that with the smallest sum should be \"RRRRDDDD\". Therefore, we can first start with the path with the smallest sum like \"RRR...RRRDDD...DDDD\", and then move the first \"R\" to the right one by one until the farthest right, and then move a second \"R\" to the right in the same, until all the \"R\"s have been moved to the farthest right of the path, which makes the largest sum. \n",

    "Therefore, there should be a small rod on the farthest right. And the remaining undistributed sum equates 4. Apparently, there is no space for it until the right of 4th large rod. Since we use two small rods now, there are $8-2=6$ rods which should be still on the very left. Therefore, the path should be \"RRRRRRDDDDRDDDDR\" (see below). However, it should be noted that the answer is not unique, but my method do not rely on heavy calculation or search.\n",
